# Las-Vegas
A simple Simulation of differences between Backtracking and a Constrained Las Vegas algorithm for solving the 8-Queen Problem.

For accurate runtimes, remove the two lines in both algorithms that delay the algorithm. This is done because It makes the Simulation look better.
(Lines 188 and 247)
```Java
try {Thread.sleep(50);} catch (InterruptedException e) {return null;}
